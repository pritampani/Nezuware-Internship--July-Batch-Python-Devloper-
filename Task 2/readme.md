# Tic Tac Toe Game

Welcome to the Tic Tac Toe game! This is a simple command-line game where two players can play Tic Tac Toe against each other.

## How to Play

1. **Run the game**: Execute the `main()` function to start the game.
2. **Player turns**: Players take turns to enter their moves. Player X goes first.
3. **Enter your move**: When prompted, enter the row and column numbers (0, 1, or 2) separated by a space to place your mark on the board.
4. **Check for winner or draw**: The game will check if there is a winner or if the game ends in a draw after each move.
5. **Play again**: You will be prompted to play again after each game. Enter `yes` to continue playing or `no` to quit.

## Game Rules

- The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
- Players take turns placing their marks (X or O) in an empty cell.
- The first player to get three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins.
- If all cells are filled and no player has three marks in a row, the game is a draw.
